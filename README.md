# hello-world

Hello world! Human here. It seems the github tutorial wants me to write a bit about myself. I'm not very good at that, but I'll do my best.

I am a unvisersity student trying to learn my way to passing with a computer science degree. I'm hoping github will get me some "hands-on" experience with programming and help me integrate myself into it's community. It's only been a year since I've switched into the computer science department and finding jobs with co-op is hard when no one wants you. I might have had better luck if I had ignored my mother's pleas to come back home for the summer - providing me with many more opportunities to apply - but I'm not complaining.

Wonderful, wonderful world. I hope that's enough of a bio to satisfy my requirements. Heh
