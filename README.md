# hello-world

Hello world! Human here. It seems the github tutorial wants me to write a bit
about myself; I'll give it a go.

I am a unvisersity student learning my way through a computer science degree.
While I don't have much github experience, I have been using git locally for a
couple years now&mdash;both for personal projects and shared. Github may help
me integrate myself into its community, it also may not if I don't put in any
effort (doesn't hurt to have an account at the very least). It hasn't been very
long since I've switched into the computer science way-of-life but I am so far
fascinated by its resilience and enjoy the callenge of coming up with solutions
for unique problems.

Wonderful, wonderful world. I hope that's enough of a bio to satisfy the
tutorial.
